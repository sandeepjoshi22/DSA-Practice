# Mistakes in Handling Circular Linked Lists

## 1. Incorrect Limiting Condition for Slow and Fast Pointers
When dealing with a circular linked list, I made the mistake of using the following condition:
```java
fast != null && fast.next != null
```
This is a valid condition for regular linked lists, but not for circular ones. The correct condition for circular linked lists should have been:
```java
fast.next != head && fast.next.next != head
```

## 2. Improper Handling of Even and Odd Number of Nodes
I failed to thoroughly think about managing even and odd numbers of nodes in the list, which led to issues when trying to correctly close the two resulting circular linked lists. This oversight also caused me to use the incorrect condition:
```java
fast != null && fast.next != null
```
